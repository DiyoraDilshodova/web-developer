          <h2>History of Web Development:</h2>
          <p>
            Web development started in <u>1991</u> when Tim Berners-Lee created the
            first website, marking the beginning of the World Wide Web. Early
            websites were simple and text-based. Later, <u>HTML, CSS,</u> and
            <u>JavaScript</u> were developed, allowing web pages to include styles,
            layouts, and interactive features. As the internet grew during the
            2000s, websites became more complex, and the role of web developers
            became increasingly important. Today, web developers are essential
            professionals who build the backbone of the modern internet.

          <h2>Who are they and what do they do?</h2>
          <p>
            A web developer is a skilled professional who designs, builds, and
            maintains websites and web applications on the internet. They are
            responsible for creating the structure of web pages using HTML,
            styling their appearance with CSS, and adding interactivity and
            dynamic features with JavaScript. Web developers also ensure that
            websites function smoothly, load quickly, store data correctly, and
            provide a user-friendly experience. In addition to coding, web
            developers often work closely with designers, content creators, and
            other specialists to make sure the website looks good, is easy to
            navigate, and meets the needs of users. Some web developers
            specialize in the <u>front-end</u> (what users see),<u> back-end</u> (server-side
            functionality), or <u>full-stack</u> (both front-end and back-end)
            development. They also troubleshoot problems, update websites, and
            implement security measures to protect data.
