          <h2>History of Web Development:</h2>
          <p>
            Web development started in <u>1991</u> when Tim Berners-Lee created
            the first website, marking the beginning of the World Wide Web.
            Early websites were simple and text-based. Later,
            <u>HTML, CSS,</u> and <u>JavaScript</u> were developed, allowing web
            pages to include styles, layouts, and interactive features. As the
            internet grew during the 2000s, websites became more complex, and
            the role of web developers became increasingly important. Today, web
            developers are essential professionals who build the backbone of the
            modern internet.

        <div class="container2">
          <h2>Who are they and what do they do?</h2>
          <p>
            A web developer is a skilled professional who designs, builds, and
            maintains websites and web applications on the internet. They are
            responsible for creating the structure of web pages using HTML,
            styling their appearance with CSS, and adding interactivity and
            dynamic features with JavaScript. Web developers also ensure that
            websites function smoothly, load quickly, store data correctly, and
            provide a user-friendly experience. In addition to coding, web
            developers often work closely with designers, content creators, and
            other specialists to make sure the website looks good, is easy to
            navigate, and meets the needs of users. Some web developers
            specialize in the <u>front-end</u> (what users see),<u> back-end</u>
            (server-side functionality), or <u>full-stack</u> (both front-end
            and back-end) development. They also troubleshoot problems, update
            websites, and implement security measures to protect data.

              HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the main markup language used
              to create web pages. It allows you to add text, images, links,
              lists, tables, and other elements to a webpage. HTML is the
              foundation of web development. Anyone who wants to become a
              frontend developer must first learn HTML.

            <p>
              CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to style web
              pages. It allows you to add colors, fonts, backgrounds, sizes,
              layouts, and animations. If HTML is the skeleton of a webpage, CSS
              creates its appearance and design.
            </p>

          <div>
            <img src="/img/script.jpg" alt="" />
            <p>
              JavaScript (JS) is a programming language that adds interactivity
              to web pages. It allows you to work with buttons, forms,
              animations, and dynamically change page elements. If HTML is the
              skeleton of a webpage and CSS is its appearance, JavaScript brings
              the page to life
