          <h2>History of Web Development:</h2>
          <p>
            Web development started in <u>1991</u> when Tim Berners-Lee created
            the first website, marking the beginning of the World Wide Web.
            Early websites were simple and text-based. Later,
            <u>HTML, CSS,</u> and <u>JavaScript</u> were developed, allowing web
            pages to include styles, layouts, and interactive features. As the
            internet grew during the 2000s, websites became more complex, and
            the role of web developers became increasingly important. Today, web
            developers are essential professionals who build the backbone of the
            modern internet.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="container2">
          <h2>Who are they and what do they do?</h2>
          <p>
            A web developer is a skilled professional who designs, builds, and
            maintains websites and web applications on the internet. They are
            responsible for creating the structure of web pages using HTML,
            styling their appearance with CSS, and adding interactivity and
            dynamic features with JavaScript. Web developers also ensure that
            websites function smoothly, load quickly, store data correctly, and
            provide a user-friendly experience. In addition to coding, web
            developers often work closely with designers, content creators, and
            other specialists to make sure the website looks good, is easy to
            navigate, and meets the needs of users. Some web developers
            specialize in the <u>front-end</u> (what users see),<u> back-end</u>
            (server-side functionality), or <u>full-stack</u> (both front-end
            and back-end) development. They also troubleshoot problems, update
            websites, and implement security measures to protect data.

            <div class="content">
              <p>
                <dfn>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</dfn> is the main language
                used to create the structure of web pages. It tells the browser
                how to display the content and what elements should be on the
                page.
              </p>

              <p>
                Each HTML tag defines the type and placement of content on the
                page. HTML is the foundation of web development, and every
                website starts with it.
              </p>

            <div class="content">
              <p>
                <dfn>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</dfn> is a language used to
                control the appearance and design of web pages. With CSS, you
                can define colors, fonts, sizes, layouts, backgrounds, and other
                visual aspects of a website.
              </p>
              <p>
                CSS allows the following on web pages: Text color, font type,
                and size Positioning and layout of sections and elements
                Background colors or images Borders, transparency, and
                animations Making websites responsive for different devicesа
              </p>
              <p>
                CSS works together with HTML, but it is used only for styling
                and design. Proper use of CSS makes a website visually appealing
                and user-friendly.

            <div class="content">
              <p>
                <dfn>JavaScript (JS)</dfn> is a programming language used to
                make web pages interactive and dynamic. Unlike HTML, which
                creates the structure, and CSS, which controls the design,
                JavaScript adds behavior and functionality to a website.
              </p>
              <p>
                With JavaScript, you can: Create interactive buttons, forms, and
                menus Update content dynamically without reloading the page
                Animate elements and add visual effects Handle events like
                clicks, scrolls, and keyboard input Communicate with servers and
                fetch data via APIs
              </p>
              <p>
                JavaScript is an essential part of frontend development. Most
                modern websites rely on JS to improve user experience and create
                complex web applications
