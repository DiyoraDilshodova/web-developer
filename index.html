        <p>
          A web developer is a specialist who creates websites and web
          applications on the internet. They build the structure of the pages
          that users see (HTML), design their appearance (CSS), and add
          interactivity and movement using (JavaScript). They also make sure the
          website runs fast, stores data correctly, and that everything works
          together smoothly
        </p>

          A web developer builds and maintains websites and web applications.
          They craft the page structure with HTML, design the look with CSS, and
          add interactivity using JavaScript. They also make sure the site
          performs well, stores data reliably, and that all parts work together
          seamlessly.

          The history of web development began in the 1990s. In 1991, Tim
          Berners-Lee created the first website — this was the very first step
          in the history of the internet. At that time, websites consisted only
          of text. Later, the programming languages HTML (structure), CSS
          (styling), and JavaScript (interactivity) were developed.
        </p>

        <p>
          By the 2000s, the internet had rapidly developed, websites became more
          complex, and the web developer profession became highly in demand.
          Today, web developers are among the most essential and sought-after
          specialists in the world.
